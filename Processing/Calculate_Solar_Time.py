Created on Fri Jun 28 10:05:30 2019

This code was developed to calculate the solar time of a given location.

There are three needed location parameters
    1) Longitude 
    2) Local time 
    3) Current Date

The method will take in longitude as a float and then the Local time and 
Current date as a pandas datetime object

Angle for Equation of Time

The equation of time (EoT) (in minutes) is an empirical equation that corrects for the 
eccentricity of the Earth's orbit and the Earth's axial tilt. An approximation 2 
accurate to within ½ minute is:

B is in degrees and d is the number of days since the start of the year. 
The time correction EoT is plotted in the figure below.

B=360/365(d−81)

EoT=9.87sin(2B)−7.53cos(B)−1.5sin(B)

timeCorrection()
 
##########################
Time Correction Factor (TC)

The net Time Correction Factor (in minutes) accounts for the variation of 
the Local Solar Time (LST) within a given time zone due to the longitude 
variations within the time zone and also incorporates the EoT above.

The factor of 4 minutes comes from the fact that the Earth rotates 1° every 4 minutes.

TC = 4(Longitude - LSTM) + EOT
